We needed a way to assess the state of our Group Policy Objects. This script provided a quick overview by providing us with the name of the policy, when it was created and last modified, who created it, its status, GUID, location on Sysvol and its links.

The links column needs a little explanation. It will contain three numbers seperated by "-". The first indicates how many times the GPO is linked somewhere, the second indicates how many of those links are enabled and the third indicates how many of the links have that GPO blocked.
